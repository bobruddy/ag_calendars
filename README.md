# ag_calendars
Avongrove uses schoology but doesn't allow the linking of subscribed calendars to group calendars consistently. So this is a script you can run periodically to login to schoology to pull down the group calenars you care about and then copy them up to a web server. That URL is one you can link from your phone or desktop calendars and therefore get one unified calendar.
